interview_tools
===============

The goal for this repo is to have a ton of tools and algorithms ready to make online interviews a breeze.

If you are an engineer and are about to interview me, good luck!

# Tools

## Copier

The first and most important step is to find a way to copy text from a local file to a code-sharing website. This allows me to edit quickly and in my native environment, lets me do such things as write and run tests and import libraries.

### Usage

```
python copier [url]
```

At the moment, only collabedit and stypi are supported. Please check `copier.py` for the most recent list. Also note, much of the support is limited. Again, refer to the source for details.
